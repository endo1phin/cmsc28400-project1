    "First we observe that the punctuation seems to be unmodified. Because t is the most common letter and it often appears after commas, we then substitute t for space. The resulting text has reasonable spacing in terms of word length and space placement. Since the letter frequency of 10 and 12 are very similar, we group these two ciphertexts together.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then matched the second most frequent letter in these sequences, `s` with the most frequent letter `e` in our reference text. While the results are not immediately clear, we observed that the sequence `mvs` is the most common trigram in the sequences. We also noticed that `mvsm` appears in the text. These observations led us to predict `m` to be `s` since it is very possible that the latter is a plural form of the former. Together, we assumed the `mvs` and `mvsm` sequences to be `s*e` and `s*es`. This leaves 2 possibilities for the substitution of `v`, `a` and `h`. We choose `h` because `h` has a more similar reference frequency with `v`.\n",
    "\n",
    "After that we simply look for short phrases with most letters guessed, and test out potential substitutions one by one. However, in order to make sense of the most words contain the substitution, the word `scum` is substituted to `skum`. We assume that this is a misspell."
