considering how many fools can calculate, it is surprising that itshould be thought either a difficult or a tedious task for any other foolto learn how to master the same tricks.some calculustricks are quite easy. some are enormously difficult.the fools who write the textbooks of advanced mathematicsand theyare mostly clever foolsseldom take the trouble to show you how easythe easy calculations are. on the contrary, they seem to desire toimpress you with their tremendous cleverness by going about it in themost difficult way.being myself a remarkably stupid fellow, i have had to unteachmyself the difficulties, and now beg to present to my fellow fools theparts that are not hard. master these thoroughly, and the rest willfollow. what one fool can do, another can.
