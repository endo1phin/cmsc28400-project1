all through the calculus we are dealing with quantities that are growing, and with rates of growth. we classify all quantities into two classes:
constants and variables. those which we regard as of fixed value, and
call constants, we generally denote algebraically by letters from the beginning of the alphabet, such as a, b, or c; while those which we consider
as capable of growing, or (as mathematicians say) of varying, we denote by letters from the end of thealphabet, such as x, y, z, u, v, w,
or sometimes t.
