i put my finger on the stop button,but i didnt push it.immediately, i questioned why i would press it.what am i going to do with those extra 13 seconds?my night will be the same regardless.the same as last night, the night before that, and every night for the past month.i remove my hand from the stop button.if nothing else is changing, at least the numbers are.it keeps my mind busy.321the beep comes!what hysterical monotonous music!the same melody sung last night, the night before that, and every night for the past month.i take the mug andwalk down the hallway.past my dad snoring and my brother playing video games.i place the teabag in the hot water and watch the liquid turn an exciting brownish color.
