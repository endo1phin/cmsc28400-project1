moreover, we are usually dealing with more than one variable at
once, and thinking of the way in which one variable depends on the
other: for instance, we think of the way in which the height reached
by a projectile depends on the time of attaining that height. or we
are asked to consider a rectangle of given area, and to enquire how any
increase in the length of it will compel a corresponding decrease in the
breadth of it.
