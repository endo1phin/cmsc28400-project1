when the world opens up again, im gonna run to the beach and wiggle my toes in the sand. when the world opens up again, im gonna play with my friends in the park. when the world opens up again, im gonna go to the restaurant and eat pizza until my belly aches. when the world opens up again, im gonna hug my grandparents. i told mommy about everything im gonna do when this horrible virus ends. mommy said that when the world opens up maybe all of us will remember a word thats easy to forget  gratitude. im not sure what that means but i know that when the world opens up im gonna say thank you to the beach, to my friends, to pizza, and to my grandparents. it will open up again, wont it, mommy
