my pet bat has the coronavirus, but shes asymptomatic.
however, bats arent in favour right now so shes keeping her little head down.
hidden beneath her folded wings, she tucks her furrowed snout  patient hero in a world frothing to place blame.
she tells everyone that she cant infect humans, but no ones listening to facts.
she posts articles daily on social media. headlines such as:
bats not to blame: intermediate host required for human infection from sarscov2 virus.
she writes were just a natural reservoir of the disease, the pangolins are the ones being irresponsible! bats are victims too! with a picture of her wearing a face mask, looking mournful.
the pathos is wellintended but not well received.
dirty bat!
goddamn bat skum!
angry comments flow beneath all her posts.
she hangs around our bedroom, sullen  our housemates isolating her.
we watch true blood reruns and eat dry toast.
