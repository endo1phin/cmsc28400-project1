we had decided it would be best for me to stay home with lucas while my husband nate went to work; his job paid more and he enjoyed working while i was stuck in a sales role i hated. some people may not understand but i really wanted to be home; i couldnt bear the thought of being away from lucas for even a minute once he was in the world, and i cherished every minute with him.

nate would leave in the mornings around 8 and return by dinner, probably around 6. this left me alone with lucas for 10 hours a day, and at first i never left a room without him. i would carry him around with me, and would be in his room while he napped, reading or napping myself. when nate found out about this, he was a bit hesitant but understood for the first month. however, eventually he insisted on a baby monitor and some distance  lucas was becoming very dependent on me, and he wanted to try giving him some alone time.
