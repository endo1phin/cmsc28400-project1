i was thinking the other day something i wanted to share with you guys. i was thinking is there any way that you can create a file such that, that file could have its own hash number. for example you create a text file, inside that text file you have the hash that comes out if you put that same file through a hash function. i don't think that's possible (i mean maybe you can do it by chance) by can you prove that such a file exists or doesn't? is there any way you can make one not by chance (i don't think so). i would like to hear your opinions. thank you.
