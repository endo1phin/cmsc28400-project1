he is not quite like the darkrobed figure in bergmans wood painting, nor does he look like a monster hero from one of my preteen daughters computer games. no matter how desperately im trying to outsmart him, he always seems to find a way of following in my minds footsteps. hes last years song haunting from the birdless balconies of the bare branches, hes in the colourless fragrance of the first plum flowers. hes sitting on my childhoods green slide in the locked playground, hes a halo of rime frost on the blooming quince. one day i might be able to look at my deepest buried desires without hearing his laughing voice, but until he gives me a checkmate, i will never be quite sure if he can give me an answer to the very question even the knight harped on in vain.
